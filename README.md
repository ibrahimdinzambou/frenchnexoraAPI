## 🛠️ Technical Features

- **Universal Resolver**: Includes an automatic resolution engine for popular hosts (**Sibnet, Vidmoly, Uqload, Voe, Sendvid, VidCDN...**). No more `ExoPlaybackException` errors!
- **Fake-Direct Filtering**: Rejects sample links such as Big Buck Bunny and other known test URLs before they reach the player.
- **HLS Quality Extraction**: Master HLS manifests are expanded into multiple selectable resolutions when available, with normalized labels such as `2160p`, `1080p`, `720p`, `480p`, and `360p`.
- **Direct-Only Playback Safety**: Stream output keeps strict direct-link filtering (`.m3u8`, `.mp4`, etc.) to reduce ExoPlayer HTTP/playback errors.
- **Mobile Optimized**: "Embed" (HTML) links are transformed into direct video links (`.mp4`, `.m3u8`) for native compatibility with Android/iOS players.
- **Security Check**: Regular dependency audits to ensure vulnerability-free code.

├── src/                    # Source code (one folder per provider)
│   ├── utils/              # Shared logic (Resolvers, HTTP helpers)
│   └── [provider]/
│       ├── index.js        # Entry point (exports getStreams)
│       └── extractor.js    # HTML/API extraction logic

├── manifest.json           # Plugin registry
└── build.js                # Bundling script (based on esbuild)
```

### Development Setup

1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a new provider**:
   Create a folder in `src/` inspired by existing providers. Ensure you export a function `getStreams(tmdbId, mediaType, season, episode)`.

3. **Build**:
   ```bash
   # Build and minify all plugins
   npm run build

   # Build in watch mode (development)
   npm run build:watch
   ```

### Code Conventions
- Use `cheerio` (imported as `cheerio-without-node-native`) for HTML parsing.
- Import `resolveStream` from `../utils/resolvers.js` to process your final URLs.
- Always use `fetchText` or `fetchJson` wrappers located in standard `http.js` utilities to inject correct headers and avoid Cloudflare blocks.
- Prefer `fetch` (Hermes compatible) over heavy external libraries.
